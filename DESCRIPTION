    Applications to Survival and Illness-Death Models

Description: Estimation irreversible illness-death models with possibly interval-censored,
    left-truncated and right-censored data. 
    Proportional intensities regression models can be specified to allow for
    covariates effects separately for each transition. With a limited number of covariates,
    we use either a parametric approach with Weibull or M-spline for baseline intensities.
    Parameter estimates are obtained by maximum likelihood using Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm.
    With a large number of covariates, we apply a regularization on the likelihood, such as 
    lasso, elastic-net, Minimax Concave Penalty or Smoothly clipped absolute deviation. Parameter
    estimation and selection are obtained by maximising the penalised log-likelihood using 
    a proximal gradient algorithm.
