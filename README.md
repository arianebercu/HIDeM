The goal of HIDeM is to perform variable selection on illness-death models with interval-censored data. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of HIDeM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("arianebercu/HIDeM",build_vignettes=T)
```

## Examples

In this package, we choose to illustrate a simulated scenario and an application to Paquid data set using vignettes: Reg-IDM-ICT-example and Reg-IDM-ICT-Paq1000. The Reg-IDM-ICT-example takes back the simulated Scenario B -see paper- and presents the variable selection process. 

``` r
library(HIDeM)
## basic example code
```
