\arguments{
\item{formula01}{A formula specifying a regression model for the
\code{0 --> 1} transition from the initial state to the transient
state of the illness-death model.  The right hand side of the
formula specifies the covariate terms, and the left hand side must
be an event history object as returned by the function \code{Hist}.}

\item{formula02}{A formula specifying a regression model for the
\code{0 --> 2} transition from the initial state to the absorbing
state. The left hand side must be equal to the left hand side of
\code{formula01}. If missing it is set to \code{formula01}.}

\item{formula12}{A formula specifying a regression model for the
\code{1 --> 2} transition from the transient state to the absorbing
state.  operator is not required. If missing it is set to
\code{formula01}.}

\item{data}{A data frame in which to interpret the variables of
\code{formula01}, \code{formula02} and \code{formula12}.}

\item{nproc}{Number of cluster}

\item{clustertype}{In which cluster to work}

\item{envir}{The working environment}

\item{maxiter}{Maximum number of iterations. The default is 200.}

\item{maxiter.pena}{Maximum number of iterations for penalized likelihood at the update of the baseline intensity parameters.}

\item{eps}{A vector of 3 integers >0 used to define the power of
three convergence criteria: 1. for the regression parameters,
2. for the likelihood, 3. for the second derivatives. The default
is \code{c(5,5,3)} which is translated into convergence if the
respective values change less then \eqn{10^{-5}} (for regression
parameters and likelihood) and \eqn{10^{-3}} for the second
derivatives between two iterations.}

\item{n.knots}{For \code{method="splines"} only, a vector of length
3 specifying the number of knots, one for each transition, for the
M-splines estimate of the baseline intensities in the order \code{0
--> 1}, \code{0 --> 2}, \code{1 --> 2}. The default is c(3,3,3). When \code{knots}
are specified as a list this argument is ignored.
The algorithm needs least 3 knots and at most 20 knots.}

\item{knots}{Argument only active for the likelihood approach with M-spline basis \code{method="Splines"}. There are three ways to control the placement of the knots between the smallest and the largest
of all time points:
\describe{
 \item{\code{knots="equidistant"}}{Knots are placed with same distance on the time scale, time of death, last vital status or censoring.}
 \item{\code{knots="quantile"}}{Knots are placed such that the number of observations is roughly the same between knots.}
\item{knots=list()}{List of 1 or 2 or three vectors. The list elements are the actual placements
(timepoints) of the knots for the M-spline. The list may contain
one vector of placements for each transition in the order \code{0 --> 1}, \code{0 --> 2}, \code{1 --> 2}.
If only vector is specified the knots are used for all transitions. If only 2 vectors are specifified, the
knots for the \code{0 --> 1} transition are also used for the \code{1 --> 2} transition.}
}
The algorithm needs at least 3 knots in spline and allows no more than 20 knots.}

\item{type.quantile}{Argument only active for the likelihood approach with M-spline basis \code{method="splines"}. There are three ways to control the placement of the knots  according to the time considered between states :
\describe{
 \item{\code{type.quantile=1}}{Time for \code{0 --> 1} is the imputed to the midpoint between the last illness-free visit and the diagnosis visit. Time for \code{0 --> 2}
 and \code{1 --> 2} is the same t, time of death. }
 \item{\code{type.quantile=2}}{Time for \code{0 --> 1} is the imputed to the midpoint between the last illness-free visit and the diagnosis visit. Time for \code{0 --> 2}
 and \code{1 --> 2} is the same t, time of death or time of vital status. }
\item{\code{type.quantile=3}}{Time for \code{0 --> 1} is the imputed to the midpoint between the last illness-free visit and the diagnosis visit. Time for \code{0 --> 2}
 is time of death for individual illness-free. Time for \code{1 --> 2} is time of death for ill individuals. }
\item{\code{type.quantile=4}}{Time for \code{0 --> 1} is the last illness-free visit or the diagnosis visit. Time for \code{0 --> 2}
 is time of death for individual illness-free. Time for \code{1 --> 2} is time of death for ill individuals. }
}
Note that if semiMarkov is TRUE then transition the time transition for \code{1 --> 2} needs to be adjusted for the time transition from \code{0 --> 1} such that time of \code{1 --> 2} becomes time of \code{1 --> 2} minus time of \code{0 --> 1}.}

\item{B}{A vector of size the number of parameters, firstly the parameters associated to the baseline transition intensities in order \code{0 --> 1}, \code{0 --> 2}, \code{1 --> 2}, secondly the parameters of explanatory variables in order  \code{0 --> 1}, \code{0 --> 2}, \code{1 --> 2}.}

\item{method}{The type of estimation method: "splines" for a likelihood with baseline transition intensities using M-splines basis, "Weib" for a parametric approach with a
Weibull distribution on the baseline transition intensities. Default is
"Weib".}

\item{na.action}{How NAs are treated. The default is first, any
na.action attribute of data, second a na.action setting of options,
and third 'na.fail' if that is unset. The 'factory-fresh' default
is na.omit. Another possible value is NULL.}

\item{scale.X}{TRUE (default), if you want to center and reduce your explanatory variables.}

\item{posfix}{The index of parameters that we want to fix, by default no parameters are fixed.}

\item{timedep12}{TRUE if time dependent on 1 --> 2 otherwise FALSE (default).}

\item{semiMarkov}{TRUE if semi Markov on 1 --> 2 otherwise FALSE (default)}

\item{gausspoint}{Gauss quadrature points in the approximation of integrals in the likelihood (only active if no penalty)}

\item{lambda01}{Lambda on transition 0 --> 1}

\item{lambda02}{Lambda on transition 0 --> 2}

\item{lambda12}{Lambda on transition 1 --> 2}

\item{nlambda01}{Number of Lambda on transition 0 --> 1}

\item{nlambda02}{Number of Lambda on transition 0 --> 2}

\item{nlambda12}{Number of Lambda on transition 1 --> 2}

\item{alpha}{The elastic-net threshold parameter between ridge and lasso on all transitions.}

\item{penalty}{Which penalty to consider, either "lasso","elasticnet","mcp" or "scad".}

\item{penalty.factor}{A vector of size the number of explanatory variables, each element value 1 (default) if we should apply the penalization on the regression parameters associated, otherwise 0.}

\item{step.sequential}{TRUE, if we want to fix some M-splines parameters if their value is too close to 0, otherwise FALSE (default).}

\item{partialH}{TRUE, if only the diagonal terms of the second derivatives of the regression parameters should be used, otherwise FALSE (default).}

\item{option.sequential}{Parameters to give step.sequential=TRUE, the cutoff underwhich the M-spline parameter is fixed to 0, min the minimum number of iteration at start, step the number of iteration to perform after stopping to fix some parameters.}

\description{
Fit an illness-death model with a limited number of explanatory variables
 using semi-parametric approach with a linear combination of M-splines or 
 Weibull distribution on the transition intensities. 
Fit an illness-death model with a large number of explanatory variables 
using regularization approach of the log-likelihood, i.e. lasso, elastic-net,
 MCP or SCAD penalty.
Left-truncated, right-censored, and interval-censored data are allowed.
State 0 corresponds to the initial state, state 1 to the transient one,
state 2 to the absorbant one. The allowed transitions are: 0 --> 1, 0 --> 2
and 1 --> 2.

The estimated parameters are obtained using the robust Marquardt algorithm
(Marquardt, 1963) or a proximal gradient algorithm.
